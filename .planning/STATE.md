# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-28)

**Core value:** A user can express a scheduling constraint change in plain English and get back a re-solved schedule that honors it (as a soft constraint) plus a readable explanation of what changed.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — First NL Constraint End-to-End

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (First NL Constraint End-to-End)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-28 — Roadmap created (4 vertical slices, 26/26 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Vertical-slice MVP — Phase 1 proves the LLM→solver seam with ONE tool end-to-end (stub-driven); later phases broaden the tool set, add insights, swap in real Claude.
- [Roadmap]: `OverrideCall` types live in `domain/` (not `llm/`) to avoid an engine→llm import cycle.
- [Roadmap]: Overrides apply as SOFT penalties in round-2 (cost) only; never round-1, never infeasible.
- [Roadmap]: Insights are a separate on-demand, cached step — an LLM failure never fails a valid schedule.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- [Phase 4]: Penalty-weight calibration needs an empirical matrix of solver runs against the committed full-week fixture — flag for a focused validation pass at plan time (per research SUMMARY.md research flags).
